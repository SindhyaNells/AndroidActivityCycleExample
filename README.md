# AndroidActivityCycleExample

This assignment is developed to understand the android activity lifecycle. A counter is set on the Main Activity(Activity A) 
with two buttons to open a new activity(Activity B) and a dialog activity. The counter variable in the Main activity is 
passed among the other two activities (Activity B and dialog activity) and the value is incremented to 1 each time when 
the onResume() method is called in each activity.
